# prob8_9and10 fuel mpg.py
# This program computes the fuel effiency of a multileg journey either from user inputs (prob9) or a file input(prob 10).
# It takes odometer readings and gallons of gas used for each leg as inputs, and then
# uses these inputs to compute the mpg for each leg and total mpg for the entiretrip.
# It runs to program in both interactive mode as well as reading data from a file.

# Define the function
def main():

# Describe whatand how this program does as header information
    

# prompt user if data is going to be entered interactively or read from a file


# If data is to be entered interactively
        
        # Initialize variables starting odometer reading, initialize leg#, tripgal and tripMileage 

        # Get starting odometer reading and previous odometer reading (will be the starting odometer reading if this is the starting point)
        
        # Set up an infinite loop (using while true) which will continue until we hit "enter" as a blank line.

            # Prompt user for input data for current leg) Ask user for input and save it

            # Blank line ends loop - hence break out.


            # Process input - split input variable legInput by space, and save both inputs 

            # perform leg calculations and make sure the odometer reading now becomes the previous odometer reading

            # We can print leg information 

            # Increment leg counter

            # Cumulate overall trip calculations for total gallons, total miles, and trip MPG.


        # Print total trip information after loop has ended with a blank line input            
        


 # If data is to be entered by reading from file
       
        # Get name of input file

        # Open in reading mode the input file

        # Initialize Variables as previously

        # Read first line from file to get the starting odometer reading and save it as the previous odometer reading

        # Read next line from file before entering loop for reamining lines
        
        # Loop through all lines of file (remember each line has 2 pieces of data and end-of-file is a blank line - we can check for either to exit the loop)
        # So as long as tehre are two items in the line
            
            # Split input data as before and perform the leg calculations, print these, and increment leg counter by 1

            # Also, perform the trip calculations as before

            # Read next line from file - data for next leg
   

        # Print total trip information after loop has ended            


# Make sure we invoke the main() program to execute the code.
